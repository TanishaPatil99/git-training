== Git Hosting Services

Git and Git hosting services, for example GitLab, are two different things.

*Git* is a version control system, a piece of software. It can work with local and remote repositories, but it cannot store them. We keep local files on a computer, but our remote repositories need to live on Git hosting services, which are cloud platforms accessible by anyone.

*GitHub* and *GitLab* are common examples of Git repositories management platforms, but many others exist.
