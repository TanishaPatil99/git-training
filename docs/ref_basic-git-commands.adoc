= Basic Git Commands

`git init` initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking.

`git clone` creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the projectâ€™s files, history, and branches.

`git add` stages a change. This is the first step in the two-step change-tracking process. All staged changes will become a part of the next commit.

`git commit` saves the snapshot of the changes that you staged before with `git add`. Command `git commit` completes the change-tracking process and saves all changes into project's history.

`git status` shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

`git branch [branch-name]` creates a new branch.

`git checkout [branch-name]` relocates you to a branch that becomes your working branch.

`git merge` merges two distinct branches together.

`git pull` updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.

`git push` updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
