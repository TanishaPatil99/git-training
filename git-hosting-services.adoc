= Git Hosting Services

Why do we need them?

Git is a version control system, a piece of software. It can work with local and remote repositories, but it cannot store them. We keep our local files on a computer, but our remote repositories should live on Git hosting services, which are cloud platforms that everybody can access.

GitLab and GitHub are among the most popular Git projects management platforms.
